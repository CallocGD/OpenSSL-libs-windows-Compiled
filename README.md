# OpenSSL-libs-windows-Compiled
A Repo of compiled versions of openssl. I really do not think you need to spend 45 minutes compiling `libssl.lib` or `libcrypto.lib`
I'll update this repo as new versions are being rolled out. My versions are 64 bits unless someone asks me for 32 bit ones.

# Why?
- I don't use or program in pearl and I don't think you need to bloat your computer just to compile one required thingy to your computer.
- Saves you the pain of having to compile these two libraries for 45 minutes by yourself. 
- You will now be one step closer to compiling libcurl with ssl features.
- You will now be able to use the newest versions of retdec since retdec requires you to have `libcrypto.lib` avalibe on your system

## NOTICE
- I put the headers for openssl into a zipfile.
- If your paranoid about using these I don't blame you and you should compile openssl by yourself if that is the case.
