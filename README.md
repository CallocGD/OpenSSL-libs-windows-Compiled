# OpenSSL-libs-windows-Compiled
A Repo of compiled versions of openssl. I really do not think you need to spend 45 minutes compiling libssl.lib or libcrypto.lib
I'll update this repo as new versions are being rolled out. My versions are 64 bits unless someone asks me for 32 bit ones.

# Why?
- I don't use or program in pearl 
- Saves you the pain of having to compile these two libraries for 45 minutes by yourself.
